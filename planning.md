OVERARCHING PLOT PLANS:
    The player wakes up on a train traveling through the desolate and irradiated no-man's-land between Azea and the URSA, two superpowers embroiled in a deeply entrenched cold war. Hours ago, the train was attacked by squad of state-sponsored marauders -- known wayfarers who have been captured, surgically implanted with a vaporizing agent, exiled to the wastes, supplied with military-grade weaponry, and given carte blanche to kill anyone they see. The marauders' initial attack killed all but 8 of the train's 30 passengers and crew, and the train has been running at a breakneck pace ever since. The engine is close to overheating, and the remaining 3 marauders are still in hot pursuit.

    Initially unknown to the player, the narrator is actually the in-universe person whose name they choose at the beginning of the game. The player is possessing this person after they were made into a wayfarer after the mercenary attack on the train

    Player: YOU are the platonic ideal of what it means to be an investigator: 40% Sherlock Holmes, 40% Agatha Christie, 15% Columbo, and 5% Frank Drebin, you have a number of abstract memories from what you think was your life, but they are only fragmented dreams experienced in a soup of consciousness before you were pulled into this world. Almost exclusively referred to in the second person, "the investigator" is currently possessing the Named Protagonist as their avatar.

    Player character (AKA Named Protagonist): An undercover Azean agent posing as a waiter on a train harboring multinational fugitives. Embedded within the stateless community for 8 years, the Named Protagonist was attempting to make inroads with the infranationalists before being unceremoniously killed by a state-sponsored squad of freelance liquidators. Like most deep-cover operatives, the Named Protagonist has been implanted with a near-undetectable cranial device used to encrypt their memories. As a result, while the player is largely in control of what is left of the Named Protagonist's consciousness, they cannot remember any specific details from the Named Protagonist's memory. Over time, memories not related to national intelligence may emerge as the encryption is worn away by the mind's probing.

    SETTING:

        Location:
        Blackened, scorched dunes of fine carbon dust stretch for miles in all directions. Metallic fog settles slowly downwards in great slanted columns half a kilometer high. It cloaks the dust beneath such that only the very peaks of most dunes reach up past the heavy fog that settles in the low places. Every few minutes, the fog quivers and boils, stirred up by the  

        Known officially as the IQZ (International Quarantine Zone) and colloquially as "the Wastes", "Quarantine", or "the Dead Zone", the swathe of land connecting the Azean Peninsula to the mainland serves as a buffer between Azea and Ursa borders. Mandated by the Ursa/Azea peace treaty at the end of the Overlap wars, the IQZ serves to isolate the mutually antagonistic ecologies endemic to Azean and URSA territory.

        Nothing is permitted to live in or cross over the IQZ, though in practice the enforcement of this rule is far from perfect. The treaty bars any official troops belonging to either nation from entering the IQZ, so sterilization procedures are carried out by a neutral, multinational organization known as the Ecological Compatibility Council
        
        Radioactive particle beams are used to conduct routine sweeps, killing or at least sterilizing any wildlife that enters the IQZ. Additionally, both Azea and Ursa are known to exile groups of undesirable wayfarers to the IQZ, often outfitting them with anti-tamper vaporization devices, retired military hardware, and orders to kill everything on sight. Officially, these roving gangs of heavily armed and cybernetically augmented wayfarers are dubbed "liquidators", though most know them simply as "marauders". The exoskeletal armor issued to liquidators provides a near-complete protection from environmental hazards, including the radioactive dust storms and sterilization sweeps local to the IQZ. Liquidator armor is heavily integrated into the body, and cannot be removed without destroying the nervous system of the individual wearing it.
        
        While the border shields on either side of the IQZ are very effective at blocking both large-scale incursions and air exchange, small groups, vehicles, or individuals are sometimes able to cross unimpeded and must contend with the national security apparatus beyond the border. However, crossing the IQZ on foot is nearly impossible, even for most wayfarers. Without high-grade environmental armor, a human body can be rendered to radioactive dust within 8 hours. Most successful crossings are undergone with the aid of an all-terrain vehicle with armor capable of withstanding sterilization sweeps, dust storms, and marauder attacks while also successfully evading detection by border security on both sides of the IQZ. Crossing is difficult and dangerous, and is generally only done by outlaws, spies, smugglers, and traitors.
        
        A later revision of the treaty also allows for the deployment of unarmed surveillance drones in the IQZ, which are used to detect incursions and distribute kill orders to all nearby marauders. This has created a kind of competitive surveillance war, as both nations frequently send isolated operatives to cross the IQZ to infiltrate enemy territory in the hopes of gaining actionable intelligence. Neither nation is inclined to issue a bounty on a group they have operatives planted in until it is at risk of imminent detection by the enemy, though sometimes a nation is forced to issue a kill order on a transport with a loyal operative in order to preserve their cover in death. However, both nations also bend the rules of the treaty, covertly deploying counter-surveillance drones in the IQZ to protect their assets in the field and undermine the intelligence-gathering capabilities of their rival. The treaty also bans the retrieval of salvage from the IQZ, but this is sometimes performed illegally by covert swarms of salvage drones or commissioned marauder squads.

        A lone centipedal passenger train gallops perastaltically, gliding across the slip face of one of the IQZ's many barren dunes. The fine blackened dust around it sizzles and hisses from the last gamma bombardment as the train cuts through the metallic silver fog of aerosolized strontium-90. On this train, 2 undercover Azean SBI agents were tasked with finding and capturing an infranationalist data courier smuggling highly-classified state secrets into enemy territory.


        History:
        The current year is 694 PR (Post Reformation). 
        58 years ago, a long series of grueling territorial conflicts known as the Overlap wars drew to a close with the armistice agreement of 668 PR. The two remaining superpowers -- the Federated States of Azea and the Ursine Sovereign Territories --



    FACTIONS:
        Superpowers:
            The political landscape has come to be dominated by two nations, each commanding a bloc of client states and protectorates. The Northern Bloc, headed by Azea, occupies the Azean Peninsula and the surrounding islands and subcontinents, exerting control over the vast majority of ocean territory. The Southern Bloc, headed by Ursa, occupies the southern mainland, Urgonia.

            Federated States of Azea -- "FSA", "Azea",  (macronational affiliation)
                An expansionist federalized democratic monarchy centered around a verdant peninsula roughly the size of western Europe, Azea is a massive cultural and economic superpower comprised of a large number of semiautonomous states.
                
                Ithrasa:
                    Central to Azean society is a bioengineered mutualistic fungus known in common speech as "link fungus" or "Ithrasa" (with a religious traditionalist connotation), and scientifically as "Aurumaculum Reticogitans" (A. Reticogitans). Almost all living things within the territory of Azea host an A. Reticogitans colony at varying stages of aurumaculosis. All such colonies are networked together through a cultivated Ethereal structure known as the "psycelium" or "psycelial network", allowing for rapid, full-duplex data transfer between all colonies linked by the psycelium.
                    
                    While inoculation by previous, more virulent strains developed along a faster schedule, modern strains of aurumaculosis develop slowly, proceeding through a number of discreet stages, often without reaching the final stages at all. 
                    
                        Inoculation:
                            Vegetative A. Reticogitans spores are introduced to the body. In the modern day, this is typically done though the insertion of mitospores into the dermis using a needle, though in traditional inoculation ceremonies loose mitospores are packed into an open wound in a process similar to some scarification tattooing methods practiced in post-collapse Gaia, circa 700 years ago. No less than 12 milligrams of spores must enter the body and successfully embed themselves in the dermis 

                            Inoculation may also be performed using a mycelial fragment instead of vegetative spores in a similar procedure to an allogeneic skin graft, where epidermal and dermal layers containing an A. Reticogitans mycelial fragment from a same-species donor in the superficial stage of aurumaculosis is transplanted to the recipient. This is a much riskier procedure than inoculation using mitospores, both due to the invasiveness of a full-thickness skin graft and the potential for the recipient to reject the graft. As a result, fragmentary inoculation is only authorized when deemed medically necessary or when the need for a rapid inoculation outwieghs the potential risks.
                            
                            As a provision of the Respect for Biological Autonomy Act (RBAA) of 579 PR, any individual -- regardless of citizenship status -- may request a sample of up to 1 gram of mitospores from the current strain approved for inoculations by the Azean Bureau for Responsible Self-Augmentation (BRSA). This sample may be used at the individual's discretion for any purpose not explicitly banned under the Communicable Organisms Usage Code (COUC), but typically it is provided so that a prospective host may verify the sample's genome using an independent bioconsulting firm, and ensure that it matches the current BRSA-approved strain. The inoculation may then be carried out using a portion of the remaining verified sample.

                            Previous fast-spreader strains of A. Reticogitans were capable of inoculating individuals through the respiration of minute amounts of airborne mitospores. While modern strains can still colonize host organisms through the respiratory tract, they require a far greater saturation of spores to successfully take hold.
                            
                            Neither ingestion or inhalation is medically recommended as a method of inoculation, as a large enough dose will result in aurumaculosis slowly developing directly to the mature systematic stage. While this method is still used in some religious ceremonies, it is highly regulated under the RBAA because of the intense strain the host undergoes, which can in some rare cases be fatal. As such, the RBAA provisions require informed consent and a signed letter from a BRSA-approved physician. Additionally, travellers entering the Azean Interior must be stopped at the border checkpoints 

                        Incubation:
                            An intermediate stage lasting hours to weeks, depending on the route of administration and degree of exposure to A. Reticogitans mitospores.
                            
                            In modern medicalized inoculation procedures standardized by the Azean Medical Society (AMS), an incubation period of 24 hours is targeted. However, with the traditional wound-packing method, incubation times may vary significantly depending on depth of cut, size of the surface area exposed to spores, and coagulation rate. Using this method, the incubation period may range from roughly 12 hours to 3 days.
                            
                            In that time, hyphae begin to grow through the inoculated dermis, creating a localized subdermal network of mycelium. During this process, the host will show signs of fatigue both as a result of their body supporting the colony's metabolism and the body's immune response to aurumaculosis. As incubation advances, a light, golden discoloration can be seen around the inoculation site.

                            In cases of inoculation via a mycelial fragment, incubation times decrease rapidly, often lasting only a few hours. This is very hard on the immune system of the graft recipient and the tissues surrounding the graft, as the implanted colony requires a significant amount of energy to rapidly adjust to its new environment. This necessitates a nutrient-delivery system to support the colony's integration with the surrounding tissue, immunosuppressants to curb rejection by the host, and chemical treatments to stimulate the colony's growth into the nearby tissues. Once hyphae begin colonizing host tissues, immunosuppressant administration should no longer be necessary.

                        Superficial:
                            The first stage of a healthy, stable colony. A superficial Ithrasa colony is able to fulfill all of its most basic functions. However, at this stage the colony is still localized to a particular spot on the host's body, and is isolated to the dermal layer -- not yet integrated into the body's bloodstream or nervous system.

                            The colony's size depends on the initial inoculation dosage of A. Reticogitans mitospore, but a modern medicalized inoculation should result in a colony with a roughly circular shape and an average radius of about 3 centimeters. Designer inoculations are also administered by medically accredited professionals able to print a colony in any shape or design of the host's choosing. A covert colony is also available at most public inoculation clinics, and appears only as a small, golden mole placed in a location of the owner's choosing.

                            At this stage, the superficial A. Reticogitans colony serves a number of valuable functions. Primarily, it is able to enhance the body's immune system to the point that a host is highly resilient to most conventional forms of disease, including viral, fungal, or bacterial infections. This is performed through the administration of locally manufactured designer vaccines downloaded via the psycelial network. Additionally, a superficial colony is also capable of manufacturing a variety of chemically simple drugs, administered directly to the host's muscle tissue. This can be used to increase the host's resilience to pain, prevent fatigue during high-risk situations, counteract allergic reactions, and treat other minor medical conditions.
                            
                            As part of the Azean government's ongoing Ecological Integrity Monitoring Program (EIMP), basic biotelemetry, location, and health data is gathered from the host and collected in data centers operated by the Ecological Stability Agency's (ESA) Biodata Collection and Storage Division (BCSD). The primary goal of the EIMP is to identify significant deviations from the species-specific genetic norm across all hosts, ensuring that the Genetic Cohesion Quotient for all species in Azean territory remains within tolerable levels. Full genomic data is not recorded, but certain mutated excerpts are isolated by the local colony and uploaded to BCSD servers. While a superficial colony is not capable of measuring the host's precise location, a rough estimate can be gleaned from the colony's exposure to organic and inorganic airborne debris.
                            
                            A full enumeration of the biodata collected from hosts at each stage of aurumalulosis may be requested online or at any licensed inoculation provider. Data collected from sentient beings as part of the EIMP is fully anonymized by the Azean government under the Biological and Health Data Anonymization Act (BHDAA); however, that provision does not prevent law-enforcement agencies from requisitioning the EIMP database under a court-order to find a match for biodata collected from an identified suspect.

                            Without further ingestion of A. Reticogitans mitospores, a superficial colony of the current BRSA-approved strain will not grow, spread, or otherwise become any more integrated with the body's systems. However, atmospheric spore density in the Azean Interior is frequently high enough that unprotected exposure could be pushed past the growth threshhold within 1.2 to 28 hours, depending on the season and current weather. However, neither inhalation or ingestion of mitospores is recommended at this stage as a means of 

                            If an individual is reconsidering their choice to be a host to an A. Reticogitans colony, it is advised that they remove the colony here in the superficial stage. As the colony is isolated to the dermal layer, it can be physically removed with a process only slightly more invasive than most modern methods of tattoo removal. An alternative, pain-free method is also available at all public inoculation clinics in the form of a topical salve that signals the colony to regress and disappear over the course of a few days. At later stages of growth, it becomes more challenging or even impossible to remove the colony without killing the host. 

                        Subcutaneous:
                            At the subcutaneous stage, the A. Reticogitans colony has spread through the entirety of the host's integumentary system, creating a dense network of mature hyphae beneath the skin. While the subcutaneous colony is not fully integrated with the host's circulatory system, mycelial structures form around the body's blood vessels and allow the colony access to the host's bloodstream.

                            After the host ingests a sufficient quantity of spores to exceed the growth threshhold, 


                        Systemic:

                        Fruiting:


                    After an initial inoculation of Ithrasa spores, incubation times vary between an hour to a week, depending on the degree of exposure and route of administration to the body -- the fastest route being injection. During incubation, a small patch of mycelium is developed around the inoculation site, appearing as a golden discoloration of the skin. In the subdermal stage, the colony has not yet become integrated into the body's systems, and is still easily reversible through physical disruption of the mycelium and cessation of further exposure to airborne Ithrasa spores. At this stage, a subdermal Ithrasa colony serves two primary functions: to relay simple biotelemetry to the psycelial network, and to manufacture designer antibodies that protect against a wide variety of toxins and diseases. If exposure to Ithrasa spores continues, especially via the repiratory system, other colonies will begin to form within the host's body and become linked to the primary colony 
                
                This network is centralized around a number of central colonies tended by quasireligious civil servants in the Azean interior, each linked to a vast array of highly-secured biocomputing data centers. Here, highly-detailed biometric information gathered from every networked organism is organized and stored in a central database, forming a monitoring system capable of assessing the health of 

                While Azea is officially a monarchy, power is devolved to a democratically elected parliamentary system. The monarchy is mostly symbolic, as the immortalized form of Jin -- founding mother and eternal queen of the FSA -- is no longer capable of any direct influence on the governance of the Azean people. Her still-living body is the original source for all living Ithrasa colonies, growing from her now-obscured form beneath many layers of gold-yellow filament.
                
                264 years ago, in Traja -- now the capital city of the FSA (then part of Gaia, an isolationist micronation) -- Jin collapsed on what is now known as the Golden Stair. Ithrasa filaments spilled forth from her body and attached themselves to all nearby living things, rapidly integrating and symbiotizing with the biological systems they found. Protected by her fanatical inner circle, the colonies growing from Jin's body quickly grew fruiting bodies and scattered their spores to the wind. This initial strain of Ithrasa was engineered for maximum virality, and proliferated through the local ecology long before any official response could be organized by the existing governmental apparatus. Soon, the infection spread beyond Gaia's borders, colonizing the neighboring ecologies of Banth, Yndu, and Vonesia.
                
                At the time, there were two perspectives on this event, with some seeing it as bioterrorism and others as a miracle that could unite the disparate nations of Azea. To many, Jin became a messianic figure.

        Used as the player's hit points. Depleting to zero will cause a game over.
        Gained by solving mysteries, finding clues, or other means. Lost when hunches are disproven


Dialogue actions:
    Manipulate
        conspire (spend fear to gain trust, info about others)
        reminisce (spend sadness to gain trust)
        argue (spend anger for a chance to gain intel)
    Question
        probe (ask basic questions to gain curiosity)
        press (spend curiosity to gain info based on trust level. Pressing questions will be unlocked by gathering related clues)
    Read (obtain information by observing the dialogue partner without interacting)
    Chat (short, semi-randomized dialogue with unknown emotional consequences)
    Extort (spend anger and a clue to gain crucial intel)


DIALOGUE STRUCTURE:
    There are 3 stats associated with every NPC -- trust, status, and intel.
    Trust:
        Trust is a 0 to 10 measure of how much an NPC trusts you to act in a manner beneficial to them and their goals. 
    Status:
        Status is a -5 to +5 measure of how power is distributed in your relationship with an NPC. A score of +5 indicates that you hold all the cards in a relationship and can exert undue influence over an NPC. Conversely, a score of -5 indicates that the opposite is true, and it is the NPC that holds the power. A score of 0 shows that a relationship is mutually beneficial and power is evenly distributed.
    Intel:
        Intel is derived 
        

FIRST DIALOGUE: Gerard Redfield

    Possible outcomes:
        --Get information (clues)
            Manipulate a character's emotions to get them to divulge information. As trust increases, higher value information will become available. 
        --Build rapport
            Each character will have different ways to gain their trust. Some may want the player to perform tasks, impress them with knowledge, or swear their loyalty.
            You will not be able to gain the loyalty of every character in the same playthrough. Acquiring some important clues will require some characters' trust to be broken.
            When noticed, antisocial actions toward a character will reduce their trust in you, if they care.
        --Manipulate or be manipulated to specific ends
        --



I want to scale back my goals, and possibly focus in on the sleuth class as the main character archetype of the game. Finding evidence, drawing conclusions, investigating, and having breakdowns when your theories are proven wrong. Take influence from ace attorney.
all gameplay is going to center around the planned mechanics for the sleuth background. Character and narrative diversity will arise from the character's emotions and traits acquired either during character creation or through gameplay.

New concept for character creation.


Overall narrative:
Some sort of disaster befalls a train transporting people across the wastes. A number of people die, including almost all of the waitstaff. Only one waiter remains, and they refuse to work under the conditions. However, a number of powerful people are present on the train, and demand to be served. At their orders, the most freshly dead waiter was made into a wayfarer who would break the worker's one-man strike. When the supernaturalist employed by one of the powerful people attempted to summon a pliant spirit into the dead waiter's body, a mistake was made. Instead of a convenient scab, the spirit of the legendary private detective Burlock Golmes was summoned. Now it is the player's task to establish what exactly happened on this train, who caused it, where exactly you are, and what is going on.


Example of mechanics:
the rich undead character in the sleeper car will check your character for the 'wealthy' trait that can be picked at the beginning of the game. If you don't have it, he will ask your character to fetch his meal for him from the chef in the kitchen car, as he ordered it quite some time ago. if you have not found a way to straighten up your outfit before now, he will chastise you for your unprofessionalism and you will gain a goal to tidy up. When this conversation concludes, you will also gain the goal to find a way into the kitchen car.

if you approach the rich undead as a wizard, he will be quite scared of you. If you press him for information, he will cave. However, eventually he will betray you...

if you approach the rich undead while cursed, he will laugh at you.


Other Notes:
What info do you need for mysteries in the mind palace?
    mystery name, mystery status (what step are you on?), mystery description (stored in its own library), player-associated clues, correct clues, red herrings, completion condition(?)
What info do you need when adding a new mystery to the player's active mysteries?
    is the mystery already in progress, at a later/earlier step, or completed? 
What info do you need when changing an active mystery to the next step?

mystery commands:
display mysteries in progress
display solved mysteries
select a mystery, also displays theories and clues for selected mystery as well as a brief summary
commit to a theory for a specified mystery (only used after a mystery has been selected)


The player's save file should ONLY show the name of each mystery chain and the step number. Gathered clues should be stored in a list with no extra information. All information regarding mysteries or clues can be fetched from game_data

mystery data is stored in its own dictionary, the mystery_library. This dictionary's keys hold sub-dictionaries representing the different mystery chains present in the game. within each mystery chain are the steps to its completion, which may branch based on the player's beliefs and choices. Each step has its own sub-sub-dictionary, which contains info like the name of the step, the log of events relevant to each mystery, the correct clues

Clues will be automatically associated with theories. It is the player's job to gather enough clues to get a decent understanding of how the evidence supports each theory. Each clue found will increase the player's anticipation when associated with a theory. Once they have gathered sufficient evidence, the player will be able to commit to a theory, gaining a decent amount of confidence. However if a clue is found that disproves a theory the player has committed to, they will lose confidence and convert their anticipation into surprise. This malus can be mitigated by having fully identified other theories. If the player tries to commit to a theory without enough evidence to validate their belief, they will instead develop a "hunch". When a player has a hunch, they will gain confidence for each clue already known as well as each new clue found that supports the hunched theory. However, if the hunch is definitively disproven, the confidence loss and surprise gain will be increased. This will create a risk-reward dynamic that encourages the player to hunch theories and win big as a stylish detective. However, the system also encourages the player to explore thoroughly as a dutiful gumshoe in order to keep themselves from suffering too great of losses.
