OVERARCHING PLOT PLANS:
    The player wakes up on a train traveling through the desolate and irradiated no-man's-land between Aezea and the URSA, two superpowers embroiled in a deeply entrenched cold war. Hours ago, the train was attacked by squad of state-sponsored marauders -- known wayfarers who have been captured, surgically implanted with a vaporizing agent, exiled to the wastes, supplied with military-grade weaponry, and given carte blanche to kill anyone they see. The marauders' initial attack killed all but 8 of the train's 30 passengers and crew, and the train has been running at a breakneck pace ever since. The engine is close to overheating, and the remaining 3 marauders are still in hot pursuit.

    Initially unknown to the player, the narrator is actually the in-universe person whose name they choose at the beginning of the game. The player is possessing this person after they were made into a wayfarer after the mercenary attack on the train

    Player: YOU are the platonic ideal of what it means to be an investigator: 40% Sherlock Holmes, 40% Agatha Christie, 15% Columbo, and 5% Frank Drebin, you have a number of abstract memories from what you think was your life, but they are only fragmented dreams experienced in a soup of consciousness before you were pulled into this world. Almost exclusively referred to in the second person, "the investigator" is currently possessing the named protagonist as their avatar.

    Player character (AKA Named Protagonist): An undercover Aezean agent posing as a waiter on a train harboring multinational fugitives. Embedded within the stateless community for 8 years, the Named Protagonist was attempting to make inroads with the infranationalists before being unceremoniously killed by state-sponsored marauders. Like most deep-cover operatives, the Named Protagonist has been implanted with a near-undetectable cranial device used to encrypt their memories. As a result, while the player is largely in control of what is left of the Named Protagonist's consciousness, they cannot remember any tangible details from the Named Protagonist's memory. 

    SETTING: 
        Known officially as the IQZ (International Quarantine Zone) and colloquially as the Wastes or Dead Zone,

Central to Aezean society is symbiotic fungus known in common speech as Ithrasa, and scientifically as reticogitans aurumacula. Almost all living things within the territory of Aezea host an Ithrasa colony, unobtrusively dispersed throughout the body of the host organism. Ithrasa colonies are tied together through the Ether, and serve as a psychic relay to a distributed network of centralized colonies tended by quasireligious civil servants. 

        United Republic of Sovereign Ascendents -- "URSA" (macronational affiliation)

EMOTION MECHANICS:
    Fear:
        Spent as a resource to avoid immediate threats
        used in conversation to conspire, spread rumors, or incite fear in others.
    Anger/Fury:
        Spent as a resource to intimidate NPCS into revealing information. Requires the player to use a previously-obtained clue as leverage against an NPC.
        Used to rile up an NPC in dialogue
    Sadness/Melancholy:
        Sadness can be spent in dialogue to say something profoundly depressing to demoralize an NPC, possibly illiciting a useful reaction
        Use sadness to reminisce with other characters, potentially revealing information
    Anticipation/Curiosity: 
        Used to increase confidence gain
        probing questions generate curiosity and low-value clues (leads), pressing questions are more incisive and require the player to spend curiosity to be asked.
    Disgust/Antipathy:
        Spent as a resource to resist influence from an NPC or situation.
    
    Surprise(special stat):
        gained when hunches are disproved or certain clues are gained. 
    Trust/confidence (special stat):
        Only gained or used during conversations. There is an individual trust value for each NPC that can be viewed in the "reputation" menu.
        Trust can be spent as a resource to get an NPC to divulge hidden information.
    Joy/confidence/Fascination (special stat):
        Used as the player's hit points. Depleting to zero will cause a game over.
        Gained by solving mysteries, finding clues, or other means. Lost when hunches are disproven


Dialogue actions:
    Manipulate
        conspire (spend fear to gain trust, info about others)
        reminisce (spend sadness to gain trust)
        argue (spend anger for a chance to gain intel)
    Question
        probe (ask basic questions to gain curiosity)
        press (spend curiosity to gain info based on trust level. Pressing questions will be unlocked by gathering related clues)
    Chat (short, semi-randomized dialogue with unknown emotional consequences)
    Extort (spend anger and a clue to gain crucial intel)


    The player is solely driven to uncover information and solve mysteries, and dialogue with other characters is only a means to this end.
    Dialogue may 
    The player is disinterested in violence,


DIALOGUE STRUCTURE:
    There are 2 stats associated with every NPC -- trust and status.
    Trust:
        Trust is a 0 to 10 measure of how much an NPC trusts you to act in a manner beneficial to them and their goals.
    Status:
        Status is a -5 to +5 measure of how power is distributed in your relationship with an NPC. A score of +5 indicates that you hold all the cards in a relationship and can exert undue influence over an NPC. Conversely, a score of -5 indicates that the opposite is true, and it is the NPC that hold the power. A score of 0 shows that a relationship is mutually beneficial and power is evenly distributed.
        

FIRST DIALOGUE: Gerard Redfield

    Possible outcomes:
        --Get information (clues)
            Manipulate a character's emotions to get them to divulge information. As trust increases, higher value information will become available. 
        --Build rapport
            Each character will have different ways to gain their trust. Some may want the player to perform tasks, impress them with knowledge, or swear their loyalty.
            You will not be able to gain the loyalty of every character in the same playthrough. Acquiring some important clues will require some characters' trust to be broken.
            When noticed, antisocial actions toward a character will reduce their trust in you, if they care.
        --Manipulate or be manipulated to specific ends
        --



I want to scale back my goals, and possibly focus in on the sleuth class as the main character archetype of the game. Finding evidence, drawing conclusions, investigating, and having breakdowns when your theories are proven wrong. Take influence from ace attorney.
all gameplay is going to center around the planned mechanics for the sleuth background. Character and narrative diversity will arise from the character's emotions and traits acquired either during character creation or through gameplay.

New concept for character creation.


Overall narrative:
Some sort of disaster befalls a train transporting people across the wastes. A number of people die, including almost all of the waitstaff. Only one waiter remains, and they refuse to work under the conditions. However, a number of powerful people are present on the train, and demand to be served. At their orders, the most freshly dead waiter was made into a wayfarer who would break the worker's one-man strike. When the supernaturalist employed by one of the powerful people attempted to summon a pliant spirit into the dead waiter's body, a mistake was made. Instead of a convenient scab, the spirit of the legendary private detective Burlock Golmes was summoned. Now it is the player's task to establish what exactly happened on this train, who caused it, where exactly you are, and what is going on.


Example of mechanics:
the rich undead character in the sleeper car will check your character for the 'wealthy' trait that can be picked at the beginning of the game. If you don't have it, he will ask your character to fetch his meal for him from the chef in the kitchen car, as he ordered it quite some time ago. if you have not found a way to straighten up your outfit before now, he will chastise you for your unprofessionalism and you will gain a goal to tidy up. When this conversation concludes, you will also gain the goal to find a way into the kitchen car.

if you approach the rich undead as a wizard, he will be quite scared of you. If you press him for information, he will cave. However, eventually he will betray you...

if you approach the rich undead while cursed, he will laugh at you.


Other Notes:
What info do you need for mysteries in the mind palace?
    mystery name, mystery status (what step are you on?), mystery description (stored in its own library), player-associated clues, correct clues, red herrings, completion condition(?)
What info do you need when adding a new mystery to the player's active mysteries?
    is the mystery already in progress, at a later/earlier step, or completed? 
What info do you need when changing an active mystery to the next step?

mystery commands:
display mysteries in progress
display solved mysteries
select a mystery, also displays theories and clues for selected mystery as well as a brief summary
commit to a theory for a specified mystery (only used after a mystery has been selected)


The player's save file should ONLY show the name of each mystery chain and the step number. Gathered clues should be stored in a list with no extra information. All information regarding mysteries or clues can be fetched from game_data

mystery data is stored in its own dictionary, the mystery_library. This dictionary's keys hold sub-dictionaries representing the different mystery chains present in the game. within each mystery chain are the steps to its completion, which may branch based on the player's beliefs and choices. Each step has its own sub-sub-dictionary, which contains info like the name of the step, the log of events relevant to each mystery, the correct clues

Clues will be automatically associated with theories. It is the player's job to gather enough clues to get a decent understanding of how the evidence supports each theory. Each clue found will increase the player's anticipation when associated with a theory. Once they have gathered sufficient evidence, the player will be able to commit to a theory, gaining a decent amount of confidence. However if a clue is found that disproves a theory the player has committed to, they will lose confidence and convert their anticipation into surprise. This malus can be mitigated by having fully identified other theories. If the player tries to commit to a theory without enough evidence to validate their belief, they will instead develop a "hunch". When a player has a hunch, they will gain confidence for each clue already known as well as each new clue found that supports the hunched theory. However, if the hunch is definitively disproven, the confidence loss and surprise gain will be increased. This will create a risk-reward dynamic that encourages the player to hunch theories and win big as a stylish detective. However, the system also encourages the player to explore thoroughly as a dutiful gumshoe in order to keep themselves from suffering too great of losses.
