CHARACTER INFO:
Physical description:
    Gerard is a man who cares deeply about his appearance and the messages it sends about his status relative to yours. Gerard's body is long-dead but preserved and reinforced with subtle cybernetic augmentations that replace lost muscle function. His entire body and face is carefully wrapped in charcoal-grey cloth strips covering his embalmed, dessicated flesh. His smooth metallic eyes are hidden beneath his wrappings, and metal teeth glint in a predatory grin through a neat gap for his wide mouth.
    Over his wrappings, Gerard wears strictly business professional attire while traveling -- a dark grey pinstriped suit over a black dress shirt split by a thin, dark black tie made of fine velvet. His clothes are immaculately tailored to fit his rail-thin skeletal body while still hiding the protruding cybernetics reinforcing his joints and replacing his embalmed muscles. Many rings adorn his wrapped fingers with black and grey bands with subtle amethysts and onyxes. 
Bio:
    Gerard is an uncommonly long-lived wayfarer at the age of 338 (measured from time of first possession). He has been through only 3 bodies in that time, and has inhabited his current body for 124 years. He sees the age of his body as an accomplishment, a distinction from most antisocial wayfarers that body-hop with reckless abandon. Ruthless opportunism, patience, and restraint are virtues he lives by, and he seems to have little-to-no moral compunctions. He wants to accrue the kind of power that keeps him free from all borders, all laws, and all scrutiny. 

Speaking quirks:
    Gerard likes to draw things out using elaborate turns of phrase. He likes to drip-feed information, making you follow his little trail of crumbs instead of being forthright. He has a sardonic, cruel sense of humor that rarely shows its face except when he is angry or impatient. 

Clues:
    Wayfarer, Undead, 338 years old, stateless, hustlegrinder, opportunist, careful, manipulative, wealthy, commissioned this train, ordered your summoning, bystander to the attack,  

DIALOGUE
Openings:
    1: First meeting
        Gerard is curious but guarded going into this conversation. He is at a huge information advantage, and wants to determine whether you will be able to be of use to him.
        He will not show fear (unless player enters the convo with high intel), and is secretly armed with a weapon capable of disabling your body.
